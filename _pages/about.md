Hello and welcome to my website! I'm a fourth-year PhD student in Economics at Penn State University. My research interests lie in the fields of **labor economics** and **theoretical econometrics**. \\
My recent research in **labor economics** focuses on structural modeling of children's human capital evolution and estimation of causal effects of parental inputs at different stages of child's development.\\
My recent works in **theoretical econometrics** focus on derivation of optimal statistical treatment assignment rules and empirical process theory. \\
Please see the [Research](/Research/) section of this website for more details.
