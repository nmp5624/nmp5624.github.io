   title={Child Cognitive and Mental Development under Parental Threat of Corporal Punishment (2024)},
   author={Nikita Pavlov},
   abstract={In this paper, I construct and estimate a dynamic model of child development where both the child and parents choose inputs that affect the child's human capital formation.
   In each period, parents act as Stackelberg leader and, in addition to time and monetary investments in the child's development, also decide whether to announce a corporal punishment disciplinary scheme,
   which takes effect if the child misbehaves. Given parental choices, the child acts as a Stackelberg follower and allocates her time between self-investment, regular leisure, and delinquent leisure (misbehavior).
   Both the usage of the corporal punishment scheme itself and the execution of corporal punishment are allowed to influence the evolution of the cognitive and mental stability dimensions of child's human capital.
   Using the estimated model parameters, I conduct counterfactual analyses to study how children's human capital evolution would respond to a ban on corporal punishment, a ban on the threat of corporal punishment,
   and the introduction of conditional government subsidies for households with high levels of children's mental stability and/or cognitive skills.},

   title={From Rules to Hugs: The Impact of Parental Strictness and
Warmth on Juvenileâ€™s Time Allocation (2023)},
   author={Nikita Pavlov},
   abstract={In this paper, I study the effects of parental strictness and warmth on juveniles' time allocation and human capital formation. I build a structural model where a juvenile solves a time allocation problem by choosing how much time to spend on studying, delinquent leisure, and regular leisure. Her returns from studying
   and delinquent leisure depend on corresponding dimensions of human capital, namely educational capital and delinquent capital. I assume that parental strictness and warmth are capital inputs and use instrumental variables (IV) to estimate their impact on the corresponding measures of human capital. My estimates suggest that warmth has a strong positive
   impact on educational capital, whereas strictness has a strong negative impact on delinquent capital. Simulations reveal that although warmth does not discourage delinquent leisure as much as strictness does, it greatly incentivizes studying both through a direct effect on educational capital and through emerging time substitution patterns.
   At the same time, the strong decrease in delinquent leisure induced by strictness is compensated mostly by an increase in regular leisure rather than studying. The implications of these results for human capital formation are discussed.},
