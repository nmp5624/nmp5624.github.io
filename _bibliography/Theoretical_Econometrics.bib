   title={Minimax regret treatment rules with finite samples when a quantile is the object of interest (2024)},
   author={Patrik Guggenberger and Nihal Mehta and Nikita Pavlov},
   abstract={Consider the setup in which a policymaker is informed about the population by a
finite sample and based on that sample has to decide whether or not to apply a certain
treatment to the population. We work out finite sample minimax regret treatment rules
under various sampling schemes when outcomes are restricted onto the unit interval.
In contrast to Stoye (2009) where the focus is on maximization of expected utility the
focus here is instead on a particular quantile of the outcome distribution. We find that
in the case where the sample consists of a fixed number of untreated and a fixed number
of treated units, any treatment rule is minimax regret optimal. The same is true in the
case of random treatment assignment in the sample with any assignment probability
and in the case of testing an innovation when the known quantile of the untreated
population equals 1/2. However if the known quantile exceeds 1/2 then never treating
is the unique optimal rule and if it is smaller than 1/2 always treating is optimal. We
also consider the case where a covariate is included.},

   title={Asymptotically optimal statistical treatment rules when a quantile is the object of interest (2024)},
   author={Nikita Pavlov},
   abstract={Researchers are often presented with sufficient information to construct a class of consistent treatment assignment rules, all of which drive the loss function to zero in the limit.
   The seminal paper by Hirano and Porter (2009) develops large sample results to compare rules within such a class and derives treatment rules that are asymptotically optimal in the sense of minimizing mean sample loss.
   In this paper, I follow Hirano and Porterâ€™s limiting experiment framework, but instead of the mean sample loss, I focus on an arbitrary quantile of the sample loss distribution.
   I derive asymptotically optimal Bayes and minimax sample quantile rules for some common classes of loss functions, both in parametric and semiparametric settings.},
